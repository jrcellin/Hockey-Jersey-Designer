# Hockey-Jersey-Designer
Build your own customized hockey jersey

First off, this is my first repository on Github so I am not sure if I am doing this right, but here I go.

I am making a website where someone can choose what they want on their teams hockey jerseys.  
They will sequencially make selection as they navigate through each webpage.  Each page will have options such as:
- The style of jersey
- front logo
- back numbers
- sleeve numbers
- ect
the last page will be a sumbit customer and order information page.
I am making this just to work on my html, css, and javascript skill and to have something to show for during job searching.
